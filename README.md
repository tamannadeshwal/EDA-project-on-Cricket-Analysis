## 📖 Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a cricket match dataset (e.g., Indian Premier League - IPL). The primary goal is to uncover insights and trends from historical match data, such as team performance, player statistics, and factors influencing match outcomes[3]. This analysis serves as a foundation for building predictive models or deriving strategic insights.

## 📝 Project Goals

*   To clean and preprocess the raw cricket dataset for analysis.
*   To analyze team performance metrics, including win rates and the impact of the toss.
*   To identify top-performing players based on runs, wickets, and other key metrics.
*   To explore the influence of venues and conditions on match results.
*   To create compelling visualizations that communicate key findings effectively.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains match-by-match and ball-by-ball data for cricket matches.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes the following Python libraries for data analysis and visualization[4]:

*   **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`
*   **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
*   **Development Environment**: `Jupyter Notebook`

## 📈 Visualizations

Key visualizations created to illustrate the findings include:

*   **Bar Chart**: Toss decisions (field vs. bat) across seasons.
*   **Pie Chart**: Percentage of matches won by batting second vs. batting first.
*   **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Top 10 run-scorers and wicket-takers.
*   **Heatmap**: Team win/loss record against other teams.
*   **Count Plot**: Number of matches played at each venue.
